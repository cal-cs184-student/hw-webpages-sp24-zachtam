<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this homework we implemented different interpolation and mesh editing schemes. We used de Casteljau's algorithm to compute 
    Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces which involved compositing a series of simple lerp functions and produced a powerful and asthetic 
    smoothing effect. In the second half of the homework we worked with the halfedge datastructure to implement area-weighted vector normals, edge flipping, splitting, and loop subdivision. 
    This showed us how powerful the halfedge datastructure is for representing and manipulating meshes. Area-weighted vector normals allowed us to efficiently create smooth shading without increasing the complexity of the mesh. 
    Edge flipping and splitting allowed us to build up to loop subdivision which made it easy to smooth out coarse meshes to create more desirable shapes. We observered that the initial properties of the mesh can have a large effect on the 
    outcome of loop subdivision.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljauâ€™s algorithm produces a Bezier curve from a sequence of control points. 
  To do this, the algorithm involves repeatedly linearly interpolating neighboring points (with the same interpolation parameter t each time). 
  With each set of interpolations, the number of points decreases by one. 
  The last remaining point after all these reductions is the point on the Bezier curve parameterized by t. 
  The Bezier curve is the set of all such points for t in the range [0, 1].
</p>
<p>
  To implement this algorithm, we implemented a single linear interpolation reduction step, 
  which iterates through consecutive pairs in a sequence of points and linearly interpolates them given a parameter t. 
  The starter code recursively applies this step until one point remains, and then does this for all t in [0, 1] 
  to generate the Bezier curve.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  To extend the de Casteljau algorithm to surfaces, we start with a "grid" of control points. 
  We first use the 1D de Casteljau algorithm to compute individual Bezier curves for each row of the grid, each parameterized by u in [0, 1]. 
  Then, for each u, we again use the 1D de Casteljau compute a combined Bezier curve using the corresponding points on each of the "row" Bezier curves. 
  Letting the combined Bezier curve be parameterized by v in [0, 1], each point (u, v) defines a point on the Bezier surface.
</p>
<p>
  We implemented this in 3 steps. 
  First, as in part 1, we wrote a subroutine to perform a single 1D linear interpolation step given a parameter t (reduces from n to n-1 intermediate control points). 
  Then, we repeatedly call that subroutine as part of another function which reduces from n control points down to a single point (using the same parameter t each time). 
  Lastly, we wrote a method to take a the grid of control points, reduce its rows to single points given a parameter u and using our second function, 
  and then reduce those points to a single point given a parameter v (again using our second function). 
  Each point (u, v) passed through this final function gives a unique point on the Bezier surface, and the surface is defined by (u, v) in [0, 1] x [0, 1].

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we had to iterate through the non-boundary faces adjacent to the vertex. 
    To do this, we started with the vertex's halfedge h, then repeatedly executed h := h->twin()->next() to get a halfedge in the next face around the vertex. 
    Each time we do this, we compute the face area by getting all 3 vertex positions (call them A, B, C) by cycling around with next() and vertex(), then finding area = 0.5 x norm(cross(AB, AC)). 
    We then use this to weight h->face()'s normal before adding it to a "total" normal vector. 
    We also add the face area to a total area variable we hold onto. 
    When h returns to the original halfedge, we divide "total" normal vector by the total area and set the vertex's normal to the result.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We first noticed that the only features that could be affected by an edge flip are the 4 vertices, 1 edge, 6 halfedges, and 2 faces labeled in the diagram below. 
    We then labeled these features on diagrams for before and after the edge flip, with as few changed labels as possible. 
    To implement this, we first saved handles to these 13 features using a combination of next()'s, twin()'s, halfedge()'s, vertex()'s, and face()'s'. 
    Then, for each potentially affected feature, we looked at each of its members (halfedge or edge, twin, next, face, vertex) in the before and after diagram, and updated the pointers for what needed to change.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We used the same labeled diagram strategy as in Part 4, only the "after" diagram was much more complicated (see below).
    In the code, we again grab handles to all of the original features using the traversal methods.
    Then, we create the appropriate ___Iter objects for each of 1 new vertex, 6 new halfedges, 3 new edges, and 2 new faces.
    Lastly, by looking at the "after" diagram, we fill in or update each of the members for each new and old feature respectively.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement the loop subdivision, we followed the 5 step process commented in the starter code. 
    First, we iterated through all the vertices and set their newPosition fields to be a weighted sum of their neighboring vertices. 
    Next, we interated through all the edges and set their newPosition fields to be a weighted sum of the 4 vertices around them. 
    The next step was to split each of the edges. This was especially difficult since we had to avoid splitting edges we had just created. 
    To do this, we first copy and save the original list of edges. Then, we iterate through this list and split each one. 
    As we do this, we mark each edge that cuts through an old face as new, and we assign the new vertex's newPosition to be the newPosition of the edge we just split. 
    Next, we flip any "new" edge that connects an old and new vertex. 
    Lastly, we update all vertices to their new positions.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    During the process of loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges tend to get smoothed out. 
    The subdivided surface typically undercuts these sharp corners (shrinking the overall mesh). 
    However, some in the case of the cube, some semblance of the original corners remains. 
    That is, the cube does NOT converge to a sphere. 
    Splitting some edges does help maintain sharp edges because with a finer mesh, these features do not get averaged out as harshly.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  Subdividing the cube mesh results in a slightly distorted and asymmetric mesh. 
  This is because the cube faces are not split into triangles in a XY mirror symmetric way. 
  If we split each face into 4 triangles, the mesh becomes more balanced, 
  and intuitively we find that the result after Loop subdivision is symmetric. 
  This splitting also slightly reduces how much the sharp edges are smoothed away.
